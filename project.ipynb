    "The completion model used in this project is current up and until 2021 (model: text-davinci-003). In order to customize the chatbot and accomodate for recent events, the Wikipedia page \"2023 in Denmark\" has been used. This page lists current events in Denmark that year. In terms of the questions, I have picked two significant events that happened in Denmark in 2023. First, Volodymyr Zelensky's state visit to the country. Secondly, what happened during Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen's visit to space. By adding the context retrieved from the Wikipedia page to the model's completion process, the model provided appropriate answers."
